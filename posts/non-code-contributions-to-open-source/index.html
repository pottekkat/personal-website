See how you can make non-code contributions to open-source.","keywords":["open-source"],"articleBody":"Do you want to contribute to open-source but you are not sure of your coding skills?\nI have good news for you.\nNon-code contributions are more valuable than contributing code.\nBut what are non-code contributions? How can I make non-code contributions? Why are you bashing coders?\nI will try to answer these questions in this post.\nAnd with Hacktoberfest right around the corner, I hope this post will encourage more open-source contributions.\nLike most of my posts, you can read this in Tweet format like the gods intended here .\nWhat are non-code contributions? Any contribution that helps an open-source project that does not involve writing code.\nThese can be anything but I have categorised it broadly into these categories:\n ✍️ Writing 🎨 Designing 🧑‍🔬 Testing/Using 👥 Mentoring 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Community Managing/Organising  Let’s look at each of these categories in detail.\n1. ✍️ Writing If you are good at technical writing and creating content, then this is for you.\nHere is how you can use your writing skills.\n1.1 Write Documentation Contributing to documentation is really impactful.\nEven if the project is really amazing, without documentation, nobody would be able to figure out how to use it or at least would not get maximum value from the project.\nHere is a tip to help you contribute to docs:\nWhen you first check out an open-source project, go through their existing documentation and see if you can understand or use the project from what you see in the docs.\nMost likely, you will find areas that you can improve.\nOpen issues for these and try to create a pull request adding changes that you think are needed.\nIt is always helpful for projects to have a new pair of eyes look at things. New perspectives and new ideas often come from new contributors.\n1.2 Write Tutorials and Blog Posts If you have been a user of the project and you are looking to contribute to it, then this is the best way.\nYou can write tutorials and blog posts to help people who are using the project.\nYou can also share your own insights and tips while writing these.\nIf the project has a dedicated blog, you can ask to publish there or there are other platforms like this where you can freely publish content.\nI find myself looking for well-written and up-to-date tutorials and blogs instead of going through the documentation.\nThere is no doubt that these will help the project as well as the users of the project.\n1.3 Translate Documentation People from different parts of the world could use your project.\nLanguage barrier is real and sometimes people may prefer Mandarin over English.\nSo, if you know Mandarin and English or any other pair of languages, translate the documentation to the other language.\nThis will open up the project to a whole new user base.\n1.4 Take Control of the Social Handles If your project has social media accounts, take control of it and start creating content.\nEven if you directly do not have access to the accounts, get in touch with the social media manager of the project and suggest content and ways to engage with your users and community.\nThis will drive the project’s visibility and will help gain more users and contributors.\n2. 🎨 Designing If you are a creative person and loves designing stuff, this is where you belong.\nHere is how you can use your palette to help the project.\n2.1 Create Art! You can put your skills to use to create artworks for the project to share on social media, blog posts and even swags. (who doesn’t like swags!)\n2.2 Create a Style Guide Most open-source projects have a large and a geographically distributed set of contributors.\nAmong other challenges, this makes it difficult to maintain consistency in visual designs.\nAs a designer and a contributor, you can create a style guide to ensure consistency.\n3. 🧑‍🔬 Testing/Using As a user of the open-source project, there are multiple ways in which you can make valuable contributions.\n3.1 Reporting Bugs If you run into any bugs while using/testing the project, raise them.\nOpen up an issue and let the code contributors know about the bug.\nThis will help them identify and fix bugs improving the quality of the project.\n3.2 Become an Advocate/Evangelist Most open-source projects are community-driven and they usually do not have a dedicated marketing team to publicise the project.\nThis is where you step in as a volunteer advocate and talk about the project in events and social media while encouraging people to use the project.\nHere is a tip:\nDon’t even ask the project owners before advocating for the project.\nEveryone likes free marketing.\n3.3 Help Improve the User Experience Most open-source project maintainers/code contributors are usually too close to the project to realise bad and unintuitive UX.\nI am and I know a lot of them.\nStep in here wearing your user hat and report these issues.\nThey are always well received.\n3.4 Sign Up for Alpha/Beta Testing Alpha/Beta tests are controlled tests of a new feature or a release to ensure quality and user experience before making it available to the general user base.\nAs a user, you can sign up for the alpha/beta programs and test out the project before the new features are released and provide feedback.\nFeedback from these tests always provide insights that can help in iterating over the features/releases.\n4. 👥 Mentoring Pay it forward by mentoring other contributors.\nHere are some of the ways in which you can do it.\n4.1 Review Code The more people there is to review code, the better the quality of the code will be.\nHaving more eyes on the code would mean less bugs, faster reviews and a better project.\nMost projects let anyone review pull requests and comment on it.\nIf you have opinions, this is the place for you to go.\n4.2 Mentor a Contributor Are you skilled in the project’s tech stack?\nCan you help contributors make better contributions?\nPay it forward by becoming a mentor!\nShare your experiences and knowledge and empower them to become a better open-source contributor.\nThere are a lot of open-source programs which connect mentors and mentees.\nI had curated some of these in a previous article. You can check that out here .\n5. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Community Managing/Organising Open-source projects thrive as its community thrives.\nBut who manages this community? Who manages the contributors? Who manages the project?\nThis is where a community manager comes in.\n5.1 Organise the Project Stale issues? Follow up! Issues without proper labels? Add them! Does this issue still exist? Verify and close them! Unclear issue descriptions? Ask for clarification! Unreviewed pull requests? Request for reviews!\nHelp in every way you can to organise the project and make it whistle as a well oiled machine.\nFrom my experience, project organisers and community managers are well recognised in the community as well!\n5.2 Become the Release Manager A release manager keeps track of what everybody is working on and ensures that a project is ready for a release.\nSome of the responsibilities of a release manager are:\n Checking with each team Ensuring different components and features are tested Organising the alpha/beta programs  This list can go on. Basically you decide when the project is ready to make a new release.\n5.3 Organise Events and Meetups Organise project meetings. Represent your project in conferences. Organise community events.\nThis list is note exhaustive.\nGreat community managers go above and beyond and are key players in the success of an open-source project.\n5.4 Get More Chefs to Cook (I mean, non-code contributors) Engineers attract other engineers.\nBut the environment these engineers create are usually not super welcoming to non-code contributors.\nSo, become a steward of the community and make it welcoming to newcomers!\nHost newcomer meetings, share onboarding resources, connect newcomers to mentors.\nWhat would we do without community managers?\nThat’s the list! Did I miss anything?\nFeel free to add them to the comments below.\nWhat other open-source related topic should I write about next?\nComment below!\n","wordCount":"1351","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://navendu.me/images/non-code-contributions-to-open-source/non-code-contributons-banner.png","datePublished":"2021-09-21T12:56:25+05:30","dateModified":"2021-12-25T19:50:05+05:30","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Navendu Pottekkat"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://navendu.me/posts/non-code-contributions-to-open-source/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Person","name":"Navendu Pottekkat","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://navendu.me/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches&&document.body.classList.add('dark')</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://navendu.me/ accesskey=h title="Navendu Pottekkat (Alt + H)">Navendu Pottekkat</a>
