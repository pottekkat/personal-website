A little known fact about me is that I play bass—the electric bass guitar.

I'm not a good bass player but I love playing it. I'm self taught and I don't know much of the technicalities and the theories but I enjoy playing the basslines of my favorite songs.

Learning to play bass has made me remember why you should do things just for the sake of it. There is no end goal for me by playing bass. I'm not going to be a professional bassist, I don't want to be a professional bassist.

With some stability in my life now, I'm up for doing more such things and start enjoying all those little moments of joy.

Long story short, I have two new set of strings and I'm ready to _slap the bass!_
