People believe that they have experienced significant personal growth and changes in tastes up to the present moment but will not substantially grow or mature in the future.

People are unable to predict their personal changes. We see ourselves as finished products at any point of time.

The past two years have been years of change.

I am a different person than who I was on the 8th of January 2020.

I am writing a post reflecting my life for the past two years. I will try writing this down for my own edification--to see what changed and what to change going forward.
