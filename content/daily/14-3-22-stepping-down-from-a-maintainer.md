Today, I stepped down from my maintainer role for [Meshery](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery) and [Service Mesh Performance](https://github.com/service-mesh-performance/service-mesh-performance) at the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/).

My upcoming job is in the cloud native space and would be closely related to the work I did as a CNCF maintainer. _This job hasn't been confirmed yet._

I'm really excited for this new chapter. I hope to learn a lot and have new experiences this year.

I'm really going to start learning Vim today.
