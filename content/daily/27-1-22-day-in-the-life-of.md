I was in discussion with a tech YouTube channel for a possible collaboration. I am not sure if it will go through but the opportunity is exciting.

We have setup a call tomorrow to discuss further. _Hopefully_ it goes well.

Should I have a "photo of the day" section in every post?

{{< figure src="/images/27-1-22-day-in-the-life-of/group-photo.jpg#center" title="Photo of the day" caption="Kerala Digital University - 27th January 2022" link="/images/27-1-22-day-in-the-life-of/group-photo.jpg" target="_blank" class="align-center" >}}

The problem is, I have a bad phone with a bad camera. It cost me only around $100-$120 to buy it.

But that should be enough as these pictures are just for documentation.

_Let's see how long I can keep this up._

I have a sudden craving for a Shawarma. Might get one later.

I have to prepare for [my presentation at DevConf.cz](https://sched.co/siKF) on Saturday, 29th January. Seeing a lot of people RSVP to the event is _as exciting as it is nerve wracking_.

I hope to complete reading Haruki Murakami's "[Men Without Women](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33652490-men-without-women)" today after catching up on some schoolwork.

It is a _peaceful_ read. It is a _peaceful_ day. It is a _lovely_ day.
