I haven't been much of a poetry reader.

Apart from the mandatory reading in high school, I haven't actively sought poems.

I do read a lot of prose and I read across a lot of genres. But I haven't had the same appetite to read poems.

I was watching the Apple TV series [Dickinson](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8518136) and the poems were so cool, it made me regret not reading poetry more.

I am on a spree to discover poets and poems to start a habit. I also like the idea of writing poetry. But I don't know how it will turn out.

_You never know until you try right?_
