I have a good excuse for why I missed my writing schedule the past two days.

I was in deep conversations.

I love talking to a person and engaging with them completely, taking the conversation to deeper levels.

I have been sleeping at ~4-5 AM everyday for the past week because of this. This has been a good change of pace to my normal life and it was much needed.

Staying indoors and having very less IRL interactions with friends through the better part of the last two years has had a consequential impact on my life. More than what I had imagined.

Having some time and opportunity to have such conversations now has put things in perspective and made me realise what I had missed.
