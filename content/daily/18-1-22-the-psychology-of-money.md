  Imagine how much harder physics would be if electrons had feelings.

I finished reading "The Psychology of Money" by Morgan Housel the other day.

I have been using some of my breaks to organize my notes on the book to an easily consumable format.

It is a great read and every page is filled with insights that can help shape how you think about money.

I personally don't have an active experience in managing my money other than investing in some index funds and low risk stocks with a couple of high volatile stocks here and there.

So, this book had a lot of impact in me and the way I manage my own money.

People have feelings. They are not robots to make rational decisions every time. Their feelings influence their decisions.

This translates to how people make their financial decisions.

Understanding this is the key takeaway from the book.

How hard would it have been if electrons _had_ feelings?
