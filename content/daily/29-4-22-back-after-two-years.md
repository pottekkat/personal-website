[NSFW Filter](https://github.com/nsfw-filter/nsfw-filter), my first successful open source project is back on the Chrome Web Store after two years of its first launch.

It was taken down by the store for violating some policies but we fixed it over the weekend after strong support from the community of users.

We did not have any time to work on the project but an overwhelming number of users reached out to us to ask about how they can use the extension. And finally, after months being down from the store, we decided to take some time off and worked to get a new release on the store.

I'm planning a second launch next week and I hope to do much better than last time. But I don't know how I will beat being on the [front page of Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24251131).

Apple TV shows are really good. _Welcome to binge day 2._
