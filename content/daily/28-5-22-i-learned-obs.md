After hearing about it for the last two years, I finally started using [Open Broadcaster Software](https://obsproject.com/) (OBS).

My previous video recording/streaming setup was a Zoom meeting. I did not think I needed to use a streaming software like OBS. Now that I'm more invested in creating content, both for my job and side hustles, I decided to look into OBS.

But, I didn't have anything pushing me to learn OBS. I was pretty busy elsewhere, and I almost dropped the idea.

That was until this conference asked me to record with OBS. I had OBS set up within a day, and I recorded my talk.

I would strongly recommend using OBS for recording and streaming. I have only scratched the surface and have only used the basic features, and I'm impressed. Next time I need to use it, I will learn more about it.
