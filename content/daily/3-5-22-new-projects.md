I started to work on my side projects after a long break.

I had given myself a month to get accustomed with my new job before starting to work on these projects. The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow and I'm back to working on the projects.

Next week, I'll be giving a talk at a meetup after three months of laying low. Excited and scared at the same time.
