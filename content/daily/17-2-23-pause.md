I'm writing this yet again from an airport. In fact, I'm writing this from the best airport in the world.

I'm flying back to India from Singapore. It has been a fun week "trying out" a new country.

Yesterday I was at the East Coast Park in Singapore, walking along the beach.

It was an excellent place to pause and reflect on how amazing life is and how little our human problems seem in the scope of life.

Every time I have these little "pauses," I come out of it with a much better state of mind.

I will share photos and videos from Singapore after I'm less busy. So never.
