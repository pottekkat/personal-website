Easy as a Tuesday morning.

One of the things I do is I watch Oscar acceptance speeches.

I love watching those videos because you can see the effort people have put in through their lives and all that effort pays off when they win one of the most prestigious awards in the world.

I fell down the YouTube rabbit hole and watched an hour's worth of these speeches and it left me motivated.

I went out to dinner with friends and hung out.
