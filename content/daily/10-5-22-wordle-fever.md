It's been some time since I shared my Wordle scores with my roommate. I think we are at a point where the game lost its charm.

That sucks. What do I play next?

It is also raining and it isn't even monsoon. Climate changes in Kerala has been drastic in the last few years. I love gloomy, rainy days but I'm concerned about what is coming next.
