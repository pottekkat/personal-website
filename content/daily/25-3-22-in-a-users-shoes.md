One of the first things I do when starting to work on an open source project is to go through their documentation.

This includes the website, markdown files in the repos and in product documentation (UI, error messages etc.).

I wrote a huge proposal to revamp the docs today for the project I'm working on.

I look at the documentation from a user's perspective and try to find out the pain points. I document these pain points and come up with solutions ranging from changing a sentence to adding new UI elements to help convey the information better.

It is quite rewarding when the end result is a much more readable and easy to navigate documentation.

I impulse bought two Noam Chomsky books. Prime delivery is so cool that it will be delivered tomorrow.
