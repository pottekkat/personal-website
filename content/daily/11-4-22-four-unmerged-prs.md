I finished working on a big PR (+803 -688) today.

Two of my PRs were open for so long that they had merge conflicts.

After fixing the merge conflicts and opening a fourth PR to fix a CI check that blocked merging these two PRs, I was done for the day.

I have my visa appointment tomorrow. Hello Mumbai trains and traffic!
