I started writing these on 31st December 2021. As the year progressed, I managed to decline my consistency.

I have missed more than 100 days throughout the year. I have already missed eight days this year.

I don't know if it is practical to keep writing this every day, but I will write whenever possible.

I took a short vacation after Christmas and traveled across north Kerala. It was a fun change of pace.

I also spent the last few weeks planning my travels for 2023. I just started traveling for work, and I'm in Bangalore now. I will be traveling to Delhi in a few days.

I will be in Singapore next month and Bahrain the month after that.

My travel plans after March is a bit uncertain, but I will be in Europe sometime this year.

Here are some photos.
