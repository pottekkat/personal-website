I'm taking time off work to shift my focus to finishing my Master's for the next one month.

My schedule leaves me free for most nights to sit with friends and chat.

This seemingly insignificant pleasure in life made me realise what I missed grinding throughout the last two years.

I love my work and would not change it for anything. But taking time off from the grind to stop and enjoy the small pleasures in life made me think about what matters in life.

What matters to me? What do I want in life?

The answer to this question is ever changing for me. Although I have set a North Star to guide the sails, the specifics in which I plan to reach there changes. It is only natural and _we are all human_.

I leave you with one of my favorite songs from one of my favorite bands of all time.

_In the end, it doesn't even matter._
