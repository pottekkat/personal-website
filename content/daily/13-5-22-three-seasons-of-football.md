I just watched three seasons of Friday Night Lights without knowing anything about American football.

It's a real good show and I'm thinking American football is kind of cool more and more everyday.

I have to stop binging shows and I'm trying to make this my last before I stop the "vacation mode" and start working on my side projects.
