It is day 2 at my new job!

I spent today looking through prior docs to try and figure out how I can best align my goals with the goals of the team.

I had a meeting with my manager to discuss my responsibilities and how I can get up and running quickly.

I have clearer goals than I did yesterday. I have prioritized two tasks that I need to get done and I have found the people to collaborate with.

Good day today. I will stick with my keyboard for a bit longer to finish off some work I had today.
