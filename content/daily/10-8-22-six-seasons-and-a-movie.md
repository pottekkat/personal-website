I forgot how great of a show Community was.

On the surface, it looks like any other sitcom like Friends, but it is set in a community college. Different. But just like any other.

It is only when you dig through the surface you see how the show takes on a lot of different genres and experiments in filmmaking. You will forget it was a show about a bunch of misfits stuck in a community college.

I'm rewatching the show now. I couldn't help myself from binging.

Will there be a movie? I hear that talks have already started. I hope it turns out awesome!
