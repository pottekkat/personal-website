I have been going through [Google\'s Technical Writing course](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing).

Technical writing is something I have been doing a lot at my open source jobs. After spending some time on this course, I realized there is a lot to learn.

My goal is to complete the course this week and start using it in my work.

We went full solar this week. We installed nine panels totalling ~3 kW and it should cover our whole usage.
