Today I started reading "[The Psychology of Money](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41881472-the-psychology-of-money)" by Morgan Housel and I am four chapters in already.

I think people learn more through real stories and thus far, this book does just that. It teaches things by going through real-life stories of people, critically analyzing and drawing insights.

I think I will finish the book today.

I have been taking notes from the book and I will try to write a summary.

_This post is a day late. I was having too much fun yesterday night and forgot that I haven't written anything._
