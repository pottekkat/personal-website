I'm back in easy mode.

My USB-C to 4 USB-A hub arrived today and it works as I expected. I connected it to the USB-C port of my regular USB hub and connected all my peripheral devices to it. I thought it might overload it but it works really well and all my devices work smoothly.

I did this to prepare for my new microphone which should arrive tomorrow.

I use Macbook Air and it only has 2 USB-C ports. I use one of them for dedicated charging and I don't want to use the pass through charging feature of my USB hub.

So, what I setup today should work well.

And with the microphone, my setup is complete from what I planned originally.

I started reading these [series of articles](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/ceajmw/book_review_from_third_world_to_first_by_lee_kuan/) on Reddit about Singapore. To be exact, the articles are are review of [Lee Kuan Yew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew)'s—former Prime Minister of Singapore—book, _[From Third World to First](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/144409.From_Third_World_to_First)_.

I was shocked to realise how little I knew about Singapore and even though I've been there, I never thought how they grew to be a country they are today.

In the aftermath of my shock I learned a lot about the man who had the vision and means to implement the vision and how he helped in Singapore's growth.
