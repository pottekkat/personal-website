Just when I thought I had it in two.

I got tickets to watch the [new Batman movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1877830/).

I have been a huge Batman fan throughout my life—I still have Batman Beyond on VHS—and I'm excited to see Robert Pattinson in this role.

I have been shielding myself from spoilers on the internet. I will do a spoiler free review on the logs tomorrow.

I'm taking an easy day, continuing from yesterday.
