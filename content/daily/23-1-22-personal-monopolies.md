I want to be _the only person that does what I do_.

As Dave Perell mentions in "[Build a Personal Monopoly](https://perell.com/note/build-a-personal-monopoly/)" a personal monopoly is a unique intersection of skills, interests, and personality traits.

This year, I'm going to explore and redefine what my monopoly is and work towards building it through my blog and social media.
