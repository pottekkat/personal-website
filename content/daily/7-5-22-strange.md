Another day, another missed Wordle.

I watched the new Dr. Strange movie today. It isn't good. I feel like Marvel is just trying to squeeze out the last drops from these movies.

It is not worth it anymore to follow these movies. I'm not watching a whole other TV series just so I can understand that one reference.

With that said, I will surely watch the new Thor movie. It seems like Natalie Portman in back.
