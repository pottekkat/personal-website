Our local film society organizes an international film festival, Panchajanyam International Film Festival or PIFF every year. We are hosting the 13th PIFF this year. This is also the first time since the pandemic.

We have the first committee meeting tomorrow and I spent some time today preparing.

Organizing the festival and running it is tedious job but it is something I look forward to every year.
