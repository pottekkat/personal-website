I might buy the Honda CB300R.

I test rode it today, and it is an absolute beast. I don't want to go too powerful as it would be my first bike apart from the old Bullet. So, it fits perfectly in this category.

It also looks stunning. I was sold right away when I saw a picture online but seeing and taking it for a spin in real-life closed the deal. I have kept a two-week buffer to ensure I'm not rushing into anything.

But I'm 99% sure I will get the bike.

I went to a nearby dam, and it was beautiful and relaxing.
