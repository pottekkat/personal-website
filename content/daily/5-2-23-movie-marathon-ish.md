I went to watch Nanpakal Nerathu Mayakkam and Romancham today. A day well spent.

Both were good movies in their own sense.

Nanpakal Nerathu Mayakkam has a lot of interpretations, and it is best left to each viewer to decide what happened in the film.

The story and the visual imagery compete to stand on top, producing a good movie together.

I won't pretend to be a movie critic any further.

Romancham was a fun watch. The jokes land every time.

I recommend watching both movies.
