One of the perks of my job is there are always entirely different categories of tasks I need to do.

I write code, work on docs, find issues, read articles and books, meet people, give talks, organize events, and more.

The best thing about this is the ability to switch tasks. It is easy to get bored or stuck when working on a particular task, and with task switching, you can hit refresh on your brain and be more productive instead of stuck.

I can go from "this code does not make any sense" to working on a new presentation and come back to the code and make sense of it.

Task switching in this context has made me much more efficient with my time.
