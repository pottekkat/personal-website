I managed to make it to Open Source Summit Europe in Dublin!

I got my visa on Monday morning, booked tickets in the afternoon, and was on a flight by dinner.

I'm giving a talk on Thursday, and I will be busy catching up with people and listening to other speakers.

I also had the luxury of meeting a colleague for the first time. Last time I saw a colleague in person was in 2019, when I worked at Infopark in Kochi.
