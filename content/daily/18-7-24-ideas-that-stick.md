I was listening to the [How I Write podcast episode with David Perell and Harry Dry](https://youtu.be/TUMjnmfsPeM?si=fFp3CwyI8SRRWW85), the great copywriter.

The episode was about writing that sticks—the ones you see in excellent advertisements and the ones you repeat to your friends. Such skill is valuable not only when writing an ad for Nike but also when conveying any idea. People remember what sticks even when another idea is better.

For example, many startups and businesses essentially do the same thing when you boil them down to their skeletons. When there is a lack of functional differences, what sets them apart is the presentation.

This does not necessarily mean you should be clever and bait audiences into your ideas; rather, you should convey them in the most simple and elegant manner.
