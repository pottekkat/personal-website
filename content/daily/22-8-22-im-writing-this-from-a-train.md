I'm on a train as I'm writing this.

It's evening, around 4:30 PM. I'm traveling from Ernakulam to Palakkad.

I was traveling and tired yesterday and crashed early. So, couldn't log my daily updates.

Hopefully, I will be able to travel next month. I have plans to be at some conferences but let's see how that works out.

I'm working on a new blog post and my newsletter. Three posts are ready to go. The newsletter is almost ready. In the next two weeks, I will be at my most productive.

I buy too many books. I have shelves of unread books plus a kindle full of unread articles.

I don't read them as fast as I buy them. I don't even have space on my shelf to keep these books, but I still do it. Binge read?
