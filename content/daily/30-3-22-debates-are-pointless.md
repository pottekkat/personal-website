I was way into debates in college. We always used to debate politics and social issues and there always used to be people on both sides of an issue.

What I've come to learn with this is that there is no point in debating with people who have radically opposed views as yours.

Both of you won't agree to with each other and the conversation dies out when both of you rediscover that the conversation was pointless to begin with.

I should stop myself from jumping into pointless debates.
