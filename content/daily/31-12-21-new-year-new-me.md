It's the last day of the year. It might as well be my first daily log.

What do I plan on writing here?

What I did in a day? What my thoughts were during the day? 

I don't know.

I could say it is a little of everything. At least that is what I think this will be.

These pages aren't indexed on search engines and do not show up on the main page or the main RSS feeds.

It is obvious that readership is not the metric that measures the success of this little thing. So, _what do I hope to accomplish from this?_

Articulating my thoughts clearly in words is an important skill I want to build for both personal and professional reasons. Making it a habit to spend time doing that daily should help me in the long run to sharpen it.

Forcing myself to think everyday could also help me come up with more ideas for interesting posts and new projects.

The process of thinking and writing offers an introspection which can be quite valuable for personal growth.

I want to be held accountable for the things I do everyday. It is hard as it is with the pandemic and working with people on different time zones. Putting things on the internet where people or I can come back later and point to should fuel the fire and keep me motivated to do things I want to do.

In a year or so, I think it would be cool to run a language model on the blog and draw some insights on to what I write. It would be fun if it spits out my content as "depressing" right?

I'm very excited about 2022. I have been building things up in the past two years which will culminate in a grand finish in 2022.

"New year, new me" is so limited. I will strive to be better single day. To be better than yesterday.

Cheers to the new year to anyone reading this. I hope you will have a good year.
