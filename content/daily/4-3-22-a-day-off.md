I took it easy today.

Started the day with an 8 km run and workout which was followed by an endless parade of lazy activities.

_I run to not feel bad while slacking off._

~~I have been watching a lot of 80s American movies.~~ I have been watching a lot of [80s American High School movies](https://www.google.com/search?q=80s+highschool+movies).

Today I picked out [Career Opportunities](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101545/). _How great is Jennifer Connelly?_

I'm also continuing binging [Parks and Recs](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1266020/) and I also started to watch the HBO comedy [Vice Principals](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3766376/).

I'm taking a "no screens" day tomorrow to catch up on reading and some easy hiking.

Big news next week! _Hopefully!_
