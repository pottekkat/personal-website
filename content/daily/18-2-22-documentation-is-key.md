People can't use what they don't understand.

If you are building a public facing product, you need to have good documentation.

I worked on improving documentation today. I hadn't realized how much I enjoy writing documentation.

I think I am at a sweet spot where my two year experience in maintaining open source projects and my naivety looking at a new project complement each other and gives me a natural edge in finding areas to improve.

I hope to get a lot of work done over this weekend to make up for the time I spent at the beach last week.
