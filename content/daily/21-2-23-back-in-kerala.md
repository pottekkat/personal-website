I'm back in Kerala after more than a week. I did "Kerala things" over the weekend and did not rest after the week-long travel.

I spent Sunday at the [Kochi-Muziris Biennale](https://www.kochimuzirisbiennale.org/). I don't know anything about contemporary art, but it was a fun way to spend a day.

I found some of the stuff cool, but we could only go to some venues in a day. You need to spend at least 2-3 days here to fully experience the biennale.

I have a busy week ahead where I have also taken up the role of [Google Summer of Docs mentor at our organization](https://github.com/apache/apisix/discussions/8852). We received a lot of interest in our projects, so it should be pretty exciting.
