I made the easy decision to switch the Plausible Analytics last week.

I have been using Google Analytics to analyze the traffic on my site and see how my site is performing since I started.

The problems with GA were that it was too complex, added a lot of size, and did not respect users' privacy and collected a lot of unnecessary data.

Moving to Plausible was easy, but they did not have an import feature for GA4 data. This sucks because I upgraded to GA4 after Google deprecated Universal Analytics.

But overall, I'm happy with Plausible. Since it is less invasive and respects privacy, users don't have to worry about sending their data to big tech. Plausible does not use or sell any of the data they collect.

It might be a good time to evaluate the other tools I'm using and change/invest in new tools.
