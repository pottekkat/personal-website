To celebrate my first Sunday off, I went to an event just so I could have a plate for Biriyani.

It took an hour and a half for the whole trip but it was time well spent. The Biriyani was delicious.

I'm starting to re-watch [Brooklyn Nine-Nine](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2467372/). I haven't watched the last season so this re-watch is to be in a flow when watching the last season.

Lot of work to do this week!
