I have been listening to Mark Zuckerberg's conversation with Joe Rogan and sharing my opinions on Twitter. I'm almost halfway through it.

I read this interesting study about the [time till an open source alternative](https://staltz.com/time-till-open-source-alternative.html). It shows that recently open source alternatives are popping up sooner after the announcement of proprietary software. This gives me much hope as an open source contributor and maintainer.

I went to watch Thallumala three weeks after its release. The people who rated the movie 2.8/5 don't know what they are talking about. Thallumala is so well made, I didn't want it to end.
