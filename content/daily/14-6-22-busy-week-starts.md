It is going to get busy this week. I have at least five open pull requests, and I'm making more. The film festival we are organizing kicks off this Friday. All my time away from work is spent there.

I like busy weeks. It keeps me occupied and less distracted. I might go to the showroom tomorrow to book my new motorcycle. Like I said, busy week.
