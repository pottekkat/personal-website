I was working on a new article today. I have been trying to broaden the stuff I write about. This meant a lot of research and reading into topics I'm not an expert on.

Still, I don't want to write about something I'm not qualified to write. I want to give my opinions and insights on topics I'm not directly involved in but affect me.

There will always be people who say, "this guy doesn't know what he is talking about". That might be true, but it is how I see things and has a place on the internet like anything else.

I wanted Pakistan to win today after watching their first fast-bowling spell. They really gave it everything, but England was just the better side.

Big race day today. I want to see one of the mercs win.
