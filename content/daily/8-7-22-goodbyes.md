Today might be an end of an era. The last month was quite fun with all my friends back in our hometown. And today, everyone is leaving.

It sucks to have a lot of fun, and the next day, you have to leave.

I will be traveling to Trivandrum and will be here for a week. A change of atmosphere can help with my productivity.
