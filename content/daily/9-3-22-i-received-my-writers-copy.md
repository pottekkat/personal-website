My article on the Open Source For You Magazine was published and I received my copy on the mail today.

{{< figure src="/images/9-3-22-i-received-my-writers-copy/open-source-for-you-cover.jpg#center" title="Published in Open Source For You" caption="Open Source For You - Volume 10, Issue 5, March 2022" link="/images/9-3-22-i-received-my-writers-copy/open-source-for-you-cover.jpg" target="_blank" class="align-center" >}}

I have to pick up my friends early tomorrow morning. I have a feeling that I won't get much work done tomorrow.

So, I'm grinding today to get most of my work for the week done.
