It wasn't an obvious one today but I got the right letters in the third step and I had already eliminated other possible vowels that could go between the two correct letters.

I think a lot while I run. I don't have any devices with me while I run other than my wristwatch which kind of forces my mind to wander.

It's not like I have _transformative_ thoughts. I thought about running shoes today (I wonder what _could_ be the reason).

I had restarted running back in 2020 in the aftermath of the first nationwide lockdown. I had an old Reebok sneakers I bought when I was in High School and was training to join the army (17 year old me was easily influenced).

Since then, I used the sneakers for pretty much everything. I used it throughout college and was using it on my daily runs after that.

It was pretty much worn out when I started using it on my runs and after a couple of weeks, it took its last breath and gave up. _Hello, cheap sneaker I bought for a valid reason I don't remember._

Don't run 8 km everyday on hard roads with a pair of cheap sneakers. You will hurt your leg and you will hurt it real bad.

I had to quit running because I hurt my ankle _so bad_, I risked permanent injury if I kept at it. I was out for 8 months.

The first thing I did when I was ready to run again was getting a good pair of running shoes.

I spared no expense and bought the [Asics Gel-Nimbus 23](https://www.asics.com/us/en-us/gel-nimbus-23/p/ANA_1011B004-020.html?width=Standard).

I have never had a better running experience. It _is_ a game changer.

Investing on myself and buying what I need—like this pair of Asics—has had made my life much better. And these pay for themselves in bettering my wellbeing, providing more free time, making me more productive and continuously returning dividends.

I used to shy away from spending too much on myself. But, during the past couple of years, I have learned that these investments are worth it.
