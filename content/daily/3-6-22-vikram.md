I watched the new movie _Vikram_ starring Kamal Haasan, Fahad Fazil, Vijay Sethupathi, and other stars (no spoilers).

It has all the action you would expect with a great storyline and twists. Everything you would see in what is going to be a blockbuster movie.

I haven't watched the loosely tied prequel to the movie, but I was filled in on the action by my friend. I'm sure the next part would also have a star-studded cast.
