What is better than a flush?

I had my visa appointment today.

The only thing I can't stand are these overly bureaucratic processes.

I had to go through them a lot today but everything was fine by the end. Keeping my fingers crossed till next week when I should be informed about my visa.

Three of PRs from yesterday was merged today. I also saw this Tweet from a user:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="pt" dir="ltr">Comecei a ler ontem as docs do APISIX, sei lá, me pareceu mais preparado que o Kong hein? 👀</p>&mdash; Bruno Padilha (padz) (@brunopadz) <a href="https://twitter.com/brunopadz/status/1512426222931877892?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 8, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
{{< /rawhtml >}}

This is so cool! I never had people commenting online about things I worked on before!

I still have one PR remaining and this Tweet pretty much sums it up:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A PR this size is not a &quot;child&quot; PR! <a href="https://t.co/z5M23JdAev">pic.twitter.com/z5M23JdAev</a></p>&mdash; Navendu Pottekkat (@sudo_navendu) <a href="https://twitter.com/sudo_navendu/status/1513919120630329346?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 12, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
