I had a busy weekend. I was too busy to even play Wordle. There goes my streak.

I need a productive week at work. I have been chopping away on documentation for a month and it is a time consuming task. I need to get into a state of flow and chop down the blocks even faster.

I know, I'm a workaholic. I think that getting the documentation ready will get the project light years ahead from where it is now.

So, chop chop! Get back to work!
