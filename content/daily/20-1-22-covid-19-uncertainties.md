The Coronavirus Omicron variant is hitting hard in India and I'm in its epicenter in Trivandrum.

These are uncertain times. The "new" normal is just the normal.

I live in campus with close to 200 people in the same building. Isolating a case of COVID is hard both from a social and a logistic perspective.

_Half the people who get tested today in the district are positive._

So, here we are, uncertain, hoping for things to get better.
