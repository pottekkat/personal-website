Long story short, my KubeCon proposal was rejected.

It was brave of me to send just one proposal. I might not be going to KubeCon this year.

I just submitted my rejected KubeCon talk to the Cloud Native Rejekts conference, as people usually do. Fingers crossed for that one.

If everything goes wrong, there's always next year.
