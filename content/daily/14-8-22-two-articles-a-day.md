I have been more active on my blog in the last four days than over the last four months combined.

I like to be in the zone. Obsessed over something, you forget everything and focus entirely on one task.

This weekend, I had to remind myself to go for a walk or get some sleep because staring at a screen for every waking hour is unhealthy.

I finished two articles today. [The diagrams](/daily/13-8-22-diagrams-in-my-new-blog/) look good. And I also revamped my newsletter.

The newsletter will be on a biweekly schedule. It will have more content and personality than before.

All of this "work" has been fun. I haven't enjoyed creating content like this in a long time. I hope to ride this wave and see where I wash up.
