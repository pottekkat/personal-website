I have been following significantly less "news" recently.

I only read Sunday's additional paper with all the good stuff. I don't watch the news on TV or on social media.

All this has helped me escape the 24-hour content cycle. My life has improved by consuming more timeless content.

But I'm missing out on a lot of stuff. I have no clue what's happening around me! Is there a way to just filter out important news without having to do it myself? Or should I just forget about it altogether?
