I ran 15 kms today.

I haven't been a long distance runner but I do run 6-8 kms every other morning.

This was a different experience that tested my physical and mental strength.

With this newly gained confidence, I should sign up to run some marathons, or at least, half-marathons.

I forgot to take a victory selfie. Shit.
