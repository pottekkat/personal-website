I got away with Zoom recordings for virtual talks at conferences these last few years.

I wanted to learn how to use tools like OBS. But, most of my recording happened at the last possible moment, often requiring us to talk to the conference organizers to give an extension.

But this month, I'm forced to use OBS to add the conference's frame to my talk. This is good as it would prevent me from procrastinating like I have been doing for the last year and a half.

Learning to use OBS would also be good for me, as I plan to start streaming on YouTube (shh, don't tell anyone).

If anyone is reading this and is good at OBS, please share some learning resources.
