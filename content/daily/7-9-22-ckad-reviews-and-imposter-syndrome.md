I have been using my free time to prepare for the CKAD examination. Since my current focus at work is on ingress controllers, it works out very well.

Having not "learned" Kubernetes step by step, I find a lot of missing gaps in my knowledge. I hope to be good at debugging clusters after this preparation.

I also spent some time going through Kubernetes-related articles from my colleagues. When I find an issue, I report it. Still, I always end it with "I'm not so sure" or "we should also let others weigh in," surrendering to my insecurity and imposter syndrome.

I think the solution is to be really good at Kubernetes. Once I have that confidence, I think I'll be more firm in my opinions.
