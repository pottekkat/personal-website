Guess where I'm writing this from? Yes, an airport.

It seems like I can only find time to write this when my flight is delayed, and I'm at the gate after finishing all my work.

I'm off to Mumbai to give a talk at IIT Bombay about Apache APISIX. I also have some friends at IIT, so meeting them and catching up would be fun.
