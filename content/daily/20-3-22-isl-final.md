I forgot to play Wordle today and I lost my 52 day streak.

Kerala Blasters lost the ISL Final today against Hyderabad FC.

A sad day indeed.

But I had fun today.

We went out to Malampuzha to chill in this deserted spot.

And we also had a watch party for the final.

It was disappointing to see Blasters loose in the penalties but it was fun until then.
