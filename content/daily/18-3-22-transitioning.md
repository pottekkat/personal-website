I went through some onboarding process today for my [new job at API7.ai](../17-3-22-new-job-announcement).

It is exciting to start this job. I really like the project we are building and I think I can be quite impactful in stewarding the project. It is also refreshing to work in a bigger (well, relatively) organization.

I went out for lunch in the afternoon. I had the legendary NMR Biriyani after a long time. We then went to catch [Pada](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10375094/) on theatres.

I will be running 15 km tomorrow morning to Palakkad (from Chittur). It is going to be tough but I want to see if I can do it.
