I did it! 50 days!

I have also been able to catch up on my reading recently.

I'm currently reading "[The Final Empire](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68428.The_Final_Empire)" from the "[Mistborn Saga](https://www.goodreads.com/series/40910-the-mistborn-saga)" by Brandon Sanderson and "[The Design of Everyday Things](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/840.The_Design_of_Everyday_Things?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=HkAXKww4qL&rank=1)" by Donald Norman.

I picked up _The Final Empire_ after a friend's suggestion to fill the void made by the last ASOIAF book. It still haven't watched Game of Thrones and I don't intend to in the future and I hope the book series gets completed.

It has been a good read thus far. It is an interesting plot and buildup and there are a lot of questions you wish you can ask the characters. It is good fantasy.

_The Design of Everyday Things_ have been recommended by engineers all over. I decided it was time to get a copy somewhere around last year when I went on a book shopping spree. I took it out of my shelf a couple of days ago and I'm still on the first chapter but it looks promising.

If anyone is reading this, please recommend books to me!
