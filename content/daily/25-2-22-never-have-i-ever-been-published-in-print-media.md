I got an email today saying my article "How to Build a Career in Open Source" is being published in the Open Source For You magazine—Asia's leading IT publication focused on open source technologies.

This article was transcribed from my talk at Open Source India Summit titled "Building your Career in Open Source" and will be published on the March 2022 edition of the magazine.

This is the first time anything I have written has been published on a print media. And to kick off with Open Source For You is pretty cool.

I do have a secret copy with me but I can't publish it now. Sorry!

But [there is an article](/posts/building-your-career-in-open-source/) that covers the key takeaways from my talk at OSI Summit.

Me and my roommate started playing [Wordle Cup](https://wordlecup.io/)—a competitive version of Wordle—yesterday. Cool game.

I'm going to spend the rest of my day writing and reading.
