I had plans to go to KubeCon that was cancelled almost a month back. It didn't suck so much then but it is starting to suck now.

It is basically FOMO but I have kind of reached a _zen_ state when it comes to it. Still, some bits and pieces make their way through the zen shield (I still don't use Snapchat even though all my friends are in the loop through it).

I hope to attend more conferences in-person this year and travel more.
