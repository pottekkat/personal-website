It feels like yesterday when we all had wires on our devices. Now all of a sudden, people seem to have gone wireless.

I've been using wired headsets for a long time. I still can't entirely switch to wireless headphones, even though I only own one wired in more than half a dozen pairs.

But the change is noticeable. Nobody buys wired headphones or peripherals anymore. It's all wireless.
