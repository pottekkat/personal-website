It's September, and Hacktoberfest folks are already out. Let's go for a spam free 22.

I have four talks planned in four cities just in the second half of this month. I'm sure I will find time for a Hacktoberfest pre-event as well. So, this September is officially conference month for me.

I have to find time this weekend to plan the trips and work on my presentations. It's going to be a busy week! When will I prepare for the CKAD this month?
