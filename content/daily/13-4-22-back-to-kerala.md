100 days of daily logs. Wow! This has become a ritual now. I don't see it stopping anytime soon.

I traveled back to Kerala today from Mumbai. It took me 12 hrs and it was exhausting. I hope I don't have to go back anytime soon.

I came home to our 95' Royal Enfield Bullet 350 back from the shop. Photos coming tomorrow!

Now to rest and recover.
