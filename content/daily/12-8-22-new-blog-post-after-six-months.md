Yesterday, I moved my blog from GitHub Pages to Netlify. I wrote about the migration in my latest blog post, "[How and Why I Migrated My Blog From Github Pages to Netlify](/posts/how-and-why-i-migrated-my-blog-from-github-pages-to-netlify)".

It has been nearly six months since I wrote anything here besides the daily logs. With my life more in balance, I hope to write more frequently.
