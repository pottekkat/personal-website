What game are you playing in your life?

What are your goals? How are you achieving them? What are your obstacles? How do you know if you are winning?

When you realise what game you are playing, life is much easier.

You now have a direction to follow to "win" the game and you are clear about the metrics that reflect how close you are to achieving your goal or how long you can continue playing.

And, you don't have to worry about others playing a different game than you. There is no FOMO or envy because you are playing different games.
