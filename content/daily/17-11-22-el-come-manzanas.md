I signed up on Duolingo to learn Spanish. Spanish is spoken in many countries so it would be good to learn as I'm planning to travel a lot.

It would also be good to challenge myself to learn a new language.

I also have someone with me who will also be learning the language. We will be having all sorts of secret talks in some time.
