I'm reading xkcd's [what if? 2](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/60190659) right now, and what if? is a book I recommend to everyone.

The amount of work put into answering each of the absurd questions in the book is monumental. This work is driven by curiosity and is read by curious people.

I have wanted to work on long-form content on topics I like. Spending a lot of time reading and finding out about things I'm curious about and sharing it with curious people.

I don't know how successful I will be with this, but it is something I will explore going forward. It might be in a different section, but it will still be on this blog.

Currently, I'm reading, listening, and viewing a lot of stuff that I will soon write about. So stay tuned.
