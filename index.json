[{"content":"I ask a lot of questions to my peers and to strangers on public forums in the internet. This year, I have been trying to improve this process to ask better questions. Here is how I do it.\nBut first of all,\nWhat are Good Questions? Good questions are the ones which are easy to answer.\nOur goal for asking a question is to have the other person explain what they know in a way you can understand. A series of good questions is the key to a good answer.\nBad:\n J: What happens when we strip the binaries? (Too vague and broad)\nN: Stripped binaries don’t have debugging information. So its size is reduced \u0026hellip; (Answers with a lot of irrelevant information)\n Good:\n J: I see that we are stripping the binaries to reduce its size before publishing. I found that it shouldn’t affect the performance. Is that right? What other implications does this have? (Clear question, easy to answer)\n  N: Stripping only removes the debugging information. It wouldn’t affect the performance in any way. But it will be difficult to debug if we run into any issues as debug symbols are removed from the traceback.\n The Problem with Bad Questions Bad questions can derail a conversation easily.\nFor me, asking bad questions have often resulted in:\n  the person explaining things irrelevant to my question.\n  the person explaining things I have no clue of.\n  the person explaining what I already know.\n  the person not answering the question at all (especially for under researched questions).\n  All of this boils down to you or both of you walking away frustrated and without a clear answer.\nAt this point it should be fairly obvious why you should focus on asking questions properly. So, here is my process.\nWho are you Asking? Who you are asking a question should impact how you ask the question. Let me explain.\nIf you are asking your coworker who works on your project or is familiar of the particular niche, you can fairly assume that the person has some context on what you are asking.\nThis means that there would be less things for you to explain and you can build your explanation from your shared knowledge. But it is a different game when you are asking questions to the people of the interwebs.\nI have had my share of bashing from people in Stack Overflow when I began programming. I get that having a high bar for quality assurance helps Stack Overflow be the go to place to ask questions but some of the moderators are so trigger happy that they will shoot you (your question) down right away.\nBut anyway, the important thing to remember here is that the person reading your question has very little context about your situation. It is obvious when a person has put very little effort in asking questions and these questions are the first to get the bashing.\nWhen to Ask? If you have a lot of questions or if you think answering your question will take time, it is better to schedule a time when you are both available.\nIf your questions are quick, it is better to ask them right away if it ends up saving you a lot of time.\nGoogle First, Ask Later One of my biggest pet peeve is people who ask technical questions that can be answered by the first result of a Google search. It shows little effort from their part and now I just ask people to Google it and do not bother to answer until they do their homework.\n I maintain a project called Meshery and one of the new contributors (who came in to get a GSoC internship ) literally asked if I could explain what Meshery is.\nWe have a website, 100+ pages of documentation, recordings of conference talks and technical documentation, all sent to the user as they join the community.\nYou know how that conversation went.\nIt would have been different if they had asked me something along the lines of “I have been going through Meshery’s docs and been trying it out locally. I’m not clear how Meshery adds value if a person is already using a service mesh. Could you point me to any docs where this is explained better?”.\nThink for a moment on how you would have answered in these scenarios.\n Doing a bit of research can help you build some foundational knowledge to ask a set of better questions.\nThe “Google first, ask later” motto is only good as a rule of thumb. Nothing has stopped me from asking obvious, googleable (it is a real word ) questions when in conversation with someone.\nTo sum it up, take some effort, do your homework and then ask your questions. Don’t expect to be spoon-fed.\nIs that Right? Let’s go back to the “stripped binary” example.\n J: I see that we are stripping the binaries to reduce its size before publishing. I found that it shouldn’t affect the performance. Is that right? What other implications does this have?\n See how stating what you already lets you build the rest of conversation?\nTo ask this question, you have to spend some time and dig through what a stripped binary is and how it is different from a \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; binary. The time taken to understand and formulate that question is time well spent.\nOn the receiving end, the person will see that you have spent time in this and is not just asking them to do your work. It will also be easier to answer your question building by on your foundational knowledge.\nVague Precise Questions  J: How do I use a Kind cluster to setup my development environment?\n If you ask me this, I would reply with a link to the Kind docs. But this wasn’t what they intended to ask. So they say,\n J: I tried this but it is not working.\n Well, there are million different reasons for this to not work. I am not Doctor Strange to evaluate all the possibilities in a second! A little bit more context might help.\nI will cut to the chase and say how I would ask this question.\n N: I was trying to setup Kind for my local development environment. I am on macOS. I have Docker Desktop and Kind running. I have also setup Metallb LoadBalancer and I see the external IP of the service as shown on the logs below. Still, I am not able to reach it from my host machine. Is there something I’m missing?\n Then that senior engineer with years of experience can jump right in and say,\n S: On macOS, Docker does not expose the docker network to the host. You can try port-forwarding to reach the pods.\n See how easy it was to answer?\nThis goes for all questions. The more precise you are with your questions, more easy it is to answer.\nThis also prevents the person answering from going off on a tangent explaining irrelevant details which you may either not care about or aren’t relevant to your actual question.\nAnother way to prevent shooting off on a tangent is to ask questions that can be answered by a simple yes/no.\n J: Why are we using this gRPC middleware instead of directly calling the required service?\n    J: Are we using this gRPC middleware to convert between two different configuration formats?\n  N: Yes.\n The person usually goes to explain why yes/no after this but these questions are easy to answer and I almost always get quick responses.\nThese questions are quite useful when you are in conversation with a person where they are explaining something to you. This segues into my next point.\nWhen in Doubt, Ask More Questions Imposter syndrome is real.\nWhen I started working with other people, I often stopped myself from saying “I don’t understand” thinking I would look stupid.\nI have then come to learn that if you ask a “stupid” question, you are stupid for the day but if you don’t, you are stupid for life (because you will always stop yourself from asking questions, ending up not understanding things completely\u0026hellip; umm, you get it right?).\nThis means when you get an answer and you are not completely satisfied,\n  say what you don’t understand.\n  ask more clarifying questions.\n  stop the speaker and ask more specific questions.\n  Confronting the imposter syndrome is hard but it has been helpful to me in knowing that everyone else face this too .\nWhen you start thinking “maybe I’m just not smart enough to understand the answer”, remember that people want to help you. You just have to help them help you!\nLearning in Public Ask questions in a public channel instead of DMs.\nThis may not work in every situation but I try to do this more often now.\nThis will document the discussions publicly and would also help any others looking in. You can then always point people to this discussion if they ask the same question.\nTake Stack Overflow for example. You almost always find answers to problems you are facing from questions asked by someone else.\nThe imposter syndrome shifts to the next gear here. Face it head-on.\nAsking Good Questions is a Skill And like all skills, it is sharpened with practice.\nAsking the right questions will help you extract the answers you want. In most scenarios, it is not that the person answering is incapable, but you are not asking the right questions.\nI have gotten better at this over the year and I am still working out the kinks in my process.\nThis might be a good post to come back in a year to reflect and improve upon.\nTo summarise this post in a sentence,\nMake it easy for people to help you.\n","permalink":"https://navendu.me/posts/how-i-ask-questions/","summary":"I ask a lot of questions to my peers and to strangers on public forums in the internet.

I documented what I learned and shared my experience as I went.\nLooking back at this 2.5 years later, writing blogs has helped me develop my skills, build an audience and advance my career.\nHere are my top reasons why you should start writing blogs today.\nYou Get Better Technically Writing helps to reinforce what you learned.\nWhen you are learning a new technology or solving a very specific bug that dives deep into the language, you should write it down. Write down what you learned or how you fixed the bug. This document can then work as a reference for you in the future and help others in your same path.\nBut this process helps you even more by forcing you to articulate what you have learned, helping you learn and understand the concept better.\nYou Get Better at Communicating Communication is one of the best skills you can have as a developer. It is a much needed skill even if you are not writing technically in your job.\nA lot of what software engineering is requires you ot work in teams where you have to have good communication to get the best results.\nWriting forces you to communicate well. It forces you to think clearly, formulate your thoughts and communicate the thoughts with others.\nIf there is a feedback loop where you can get comments from your readers, use that feedback to improve your communication.\nYou are Helping Others There are always people who can benefit from your content.\nThis is regardless of where you are in your career. Even though I had very little professional experience, sharing what I\u0026rsquo;ve learned and my experience has helped people trying the same path.\nCreate content and there will be readers.\nYou are Building Your Personal Brand Welcome to 2022 where it is all about your personal brand.\nBuilding a personal brand can help you in many ways. Creating content on the internet and putting your name on it is a solid step towards this.\nWhat you write will be associated to your personal brand. And personal brands helps you build personal monopolies .\nYou are Setting Up Your Career When you write online you are building your professional network.\nThis network of people who share similar interests with you can help by providing opportunities that you might have not received otherwise. They already have a picture of you and your skills form the content you write.\n It is easy once you start writing.\nYou will find more reasons why you want to continue writing blog posts and you will form a habit.\nThe important step is to just start. Don\u0026rsquo;t wait till you are \u0026ldquo;good enough\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;experienced\u0026rdquo; to start writing. Things will fall in their places once you start.\n","permalink":"https://navendu.me/posts/why-developers-should-blog/","summary":"I have been blogging ever since I started out as a software engineer. Here is why you should do it too.","title":"Why Developers Should Blog"},{"content":"  Money’s greatest intrinsic value—and this can’t be overstated—is its ability to give you control over your time.\n Morgan Housel  The Psychology of Money    These are my key takeaways from Morgan Housel \u0026rsquo;s international bestseller “The Psychology of Money ”.\nI have kept my learnings to be short and skimmable and I would urge everyone reading this article to read the entire book.\n The Psychology of MoneyPhoto by Morgan Housel on Unsplash\n  The book is only about 240 pages long and it is a fast read. I read it cover to cover in two sittings—it was a real page turner.\n Housel begins by talking about how people’s financial decisions are less mathematics, graphs and spreadsheets and are more influenced by their personal history, world view, ego, pride and odd incentives.\nHe drives this point throughout the book through 19 stories and teaches how you can make better financial decisions.\nThese are my notes—my key takeaways—on what each of these stories teach us.\n Everybody’s approach to money is different and is shaped by their own beliefs and experiences from different societies, cultures and economic conditions. The role of luck is often unaccounted. You can end up in the wrong side by making good financial decisions and vice versa. People at the top may have benefitted from luck while those at the bottom might have been the casualties of risk.  Be careful who you praise and admire. Be careful who you look down upon and wish to avoid becoming. To ease this risk, replicate broader patterns instead of trying to replicate specific individuals.   There is no reason to risk what you have and need for what you don’t have and don’t need. Your goals are never complete if you start comparing yourself with others. Keep your goalpost fixed. The role of time and compounding is important in building wealth. Ask Warren Buffet. Building wealth is easier compared to staying wealthy—it is a different game. Be optimistic that things will work out in the long term even while facing adversity in the short term. Raise your odds of success at a given level of risk. Failures are okay. Long list of failures are overcome by a small list of huge successes. Investment firms have huge portfolios and how many of them actually work out and make money? What wealth gives you is the control of time. This gives you control over doing what you want, when you want and with who you want. This is the most common variable that makes people happy. No one is impressed by your possessions as much as you are. People admire your possessions and not you. Trying to buy admiration and respect is a wild goose chase. Spending money to show you have money is the fastest way to loose money. Wealth is the money you don’t spend. It is what you don’t see. It is the ability to do/get things—time, freedom, possessions— in the future. You don’t need a reason to save money. You save money because you save money. With compounding, building wealth is more about savings rate than income (over a certain level of income). Investing strategies need not always be rational. Making reasonable choices like investing in your own country, investing in stocks you like and investing in family can give advantages. The best portfolio is the one that gives you peaceful sleep at night. Investing is not a hard science to work based on historical evidence. Investors are human and they are unpredictable.  Experiencing specific events doesn’t necessarily qualify you to know what would happen next. The events that greatly affected the economy could be outliers. Surprises are surprising.   Leave room for errors in your decision making. Think about what errors your can financially endure as well what you can emotionally endure. Your financial goals, your career goals, your life goals, change. Accounting for the unknown is hard and it is okay. The hidden price with investing is the ups and downs in the market, the uncertainty and the doubt in your mind. Be prepared to pay the price. Nothing is free. People are different and have different goals. Don’t be persuaded by the actions of people who are playing a different game than you. Understand your goals and your time horizon. Pessimism sounds smarter and people are drawn to its reasoning. But, the problems pessimists forecasts are solved by clever and novel solutions leading to optimistic futures. The more you want something to be true, the more likely you are to believe a story that overestimates the odds of it being true. These “appealing fictions” have significant impact on our investments.   This book is a must read if you are serious about investing, building wealth and being financially independent.\nThe book costs $16 and ₹269 on Amazon.\n","permalink":"https://navendu.me/posts/the-psychology-of-money/","summary":"Key takeaways from Morgan Housel’s international bestseller “The Psychology of Money”—brief and to the point.","title":"Key Takeaways from Morgan Housel's \"The Psychology of Money\""},{"content":"Contributing to open-source can be overwhelming.\nYou are creating a pull request to an open-source project that would open up your code for people to give feedback and criticise.\nThis turns off a lot of new contributors from making an impact in open-source.\nYou might also be at a point where you are not confident enough in your programming skills that you hesitate to take that first step in contributing code.\nA good way to tackle this and gain confidence to contribute code is to start by contributing to documentation.\nDocumentation is necessary for every open-source project. Contributing to and maintaining documentation is not an easy task but is highly impactful.\nI will drop a bomb and say contributing to documentation is more important than contributing code.\nIn this post, I will try to share my insights on contributing to documentation from my experience as an open-source contributor and a maintainer.\n Being overwhelmed when you first start to contribute to open-source is natural. Start small. But start.\n Finding a Project The first thing to do before you can start contributing is finding a project you can contribute to. And the best project to contribute to is the one you have been using for a while.\nThat is, if you have been using a framework or a library, a tool or any other open-source project, contribute to it.\nWith this, you will have a lot of context on what the project is and you will definitely be able to find areas in the documentation you can improve.\nIf you cannot find such a project to contribute to, look for projects with an active community of contributors.\nCommunity is key in open-source and you will definitely reap the rewards for being part of a thriving community.\nAll these factors comes secondary to the fact that you should always contribute to projects that YOU are interested in.\nStart as a User As mentioned in the above section, you will be able to make impactful contributions if you are already a user of the project.\nSo, if you aren\u0026rsquo;t, you should start by exploring the project from the perspective of a user.\nAs a user, you will likely go through documentation and tutorials as you start out and you are likely to find bugs, out-dated content or things you can improve.\nWhen you find areas to improve, open up issues (or any form of tickets if you are not using GitHub) for these and discuss with a project maintainer to validate it and get it assigned to you.\nOnce you have been assigned an issue, you can start contributing.\nReview the Contributing Guidelines Most (if not all) open-source projects will have a contributing guideline in their GitHub/GitLab repository.\nThis document will be geared towards contributors with guidelines on setting up a developer environment and how you can make contributions.\nRead these guidelines carefully and make sure that you follow them.\nFor example, if a project requires you to sign every commit, your pull requests will be rejected very quickly if you do not do it.\nWhat should you Document? As mentioned in the previous sections, you are likely to find issues when you start to use the project referring to the documentation.\nThis could be as simple as an outdated screenshot to outdated or missing documentation.\nOpen up issues for these as mentioned and discuss it with a maintainer to get it assigned to you.\nIf you cannot find issues by yourself, you can try to fix already open issues.\nThere are labels in GitHub issues that can help you filer out only \u0026ldquo;documentation\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;docs\u0026rdquo; issues and similar features will be there in any ticketing system being used by the project.\nIn-Code Documentation People generally don\u0026rsquo;t think of this when they think about documentation.\nIn-code documentation refers to the error messages, help texts and other text the user interacts with that doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily affect the \u0026ldquo;logic\u0026rdquo; of the code.\nThese are really important as users will definitely interact with this while using the project.\nAs a new contributor you have the magic eyes to spot issues with these that seasoned contributors are too close to notice.\nMore Ways to go Beyond the Docs Page Good documentation is not just limited to the docs page.\nIt can also involve:\n Writing a blog post that takes the user through a new feature Creating a Twitter thread about the project Documenting processes that can be used for the community (a contributing guide for example) Updating the project\u0026rsquo;s website  You can always ask the project maintainers to help you find areas that need contributions.\nBefore we finish this, I want to point out that non-code open-source contributions are not just limited to writing documentation.\nYou can check out other ways you can contribute to open-source projects without contributing code .\n","permalink":"https://navendu.me/posts/contributing-to-documentation/","summary":"Contributing to documentation is really impactful for an open-source project. It can also be a stepping stone to make code contributions. Learn how.","title":"Contributing to Documentation in Open-Source"},{"content":"Contributing to open source is a great way to hone your skills while working on real world projects. But, for new developers, this process can seem daunting.\nAfter all, when you create a pull request, you are opening up your code for people to give feedback and criticize.\nThis is where open source mentorship programs like Google Summer of Code (GSoC) come in and bridge the gap between new developers and large open-source codebases.\nWhat is Google Summer of Code (GSoC)? GSoC is an annual program from Google focusing on bringing students and new developers into to open source.\nEach summer, participating mentees get to work on open source projects from the hundreds of organizations that participate in GSoC. The participating mentees are paired with mentors from the participating organizations and are also paid a stipend during their period of mentorship.\nHere is a quick summary of the program before we dive deep into the details.\n   Duration Timeline Stipend Eligibility     12 Weeks, ˜3 Months (Could be increased up to 22 weeks ) February 7th - November 28th  $1500 - $3300  Anyone about 18 years of age     Stick around till the end to learn more on how you can get selected and my tips as a GSoC mentor.\n This year, GSoC is open to everyone above the age of 18 and not just students.\n Why Should I Participate in GSoC? According to Linux Foundation\u0026#39;s 2021 Open Source Jobs Report , 92% of employers say finding people with open source skills is difficult.\nOpen source skills are in demand and there is definitely a lack of supply.\nParticipating in programs like GSoC helps you:\n Gain real world experience Build your network Boost your career Get a stable stipend  The goal of GSoC is to enable mentees to be good open source stewards. Successfully completing GSoC can open doors for you and could even lead to a career in open source .\nAm I Eligible to Participate? With the new rules for 2022 , everyone over the age of 18 is eligible to participate.\nYou should also have a strong desire to contribute to open source and help the community of course!\nWhen does GSoC Start? Organizations start applying from February 7th.\nMentees can start applying from April 4th till April 19th.\nSee the 2022 timeline for GSoC for other details.\nHow Long is the Program? This time around, mentors and mentees can extend the period of GSoC up to 22 weeks instead of the mandatory 12 weeks as in previous years.\nSee the dates of each program milestones for a better idea on the timeline.\nHow do I Apply? You can apply on the GSoC website when the application period starts.\nThe application process is mainly these 3 steps:\n Selecting an organization Selecting a project Preparing a project proposal  How do I Select an Organization? GSoC has hundreds of participating organizations each year. Mentees can apply to any of these organizations, but filtering through them and deciding which to contribute to can be difficult without a proper plan.\nSo, to be in the best position when the application process starts, you have to be prepared.\nYou can find organizations to contribute to even before they are officially announced. I would suggest following the steps below.\n Write down what skills/ tech stack you know currently Write down the skills/ tech stack you want to learn Filter organizations based on these two criteria Look through the projects in the organization to find what interests you List down multiple projects across organizations that fit this criteria  How do I Select a Project? You would have now narrowed down to a couple of projects under the same or different organizations. How do you go from here? How do you know which project to submit a proposal to?\nThe key here is homework. You need to learn more about the projects.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what I suggest doing:\n Start by using the project and see how it works (Is it cool?) Go through the project\u0026rsquo;s documentation and contributing guidelines (Are there well documented processes?) Join the project\u0026rsquo;s community channel (Slack, Discord, mailing lists) (Are they active and welcoming?) Pick up a \u0026ldquo;good first issue\u0026rdquo; and try to fix it (Is it doable? Do you get support from the mentors/maintainers?) Ask clarifying questions about the project on the communication channels (Do you get answers?)  If the answer to all these questions is a solid \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo;, then you need to ask yourself the golden question.\n\u0026ldquo;Do I want to contribute to this project?\u0026rdquo;.\nYou know what to do next.\nHow do I Submit a Proposal? Now that you have a project(s) chosen, it is time for the biggest step yet. Submitting a proposal.\nLike other open source mentorship programs, GSoC can also get competitive. You have to make your proposal stand out to get accepted.\nGSoC\u0026rsquo;s official guides outline what is expected in a proposal and also shows some examples of good proposals .\nIt is important that you communicate with your potential mentors prior to submitting a proposal to make sure that you have the right idea. Clarify the deliverables and establish a realistic deadline before you start writing the proposal.\nIf you already have prior contributions before you submit the proposal, it would definitely put your application in front.\nHow will I Get Selected? Once you submit the proposal, the mentors will go through each submission and will let you know if you get selected or not.\nIf you get selected, it\u0026rsquo;s time to celebrate!\nWhat if I don\u0026rsquo;t get Selected? Don\u0026rsquo;t stop contributing!\nGSoC is highly competitive and it is difficult to get selected. But you don\u0026rsquo;t have to be a GSoC mentee to contribute to open source. You can do it independently!\nThe spirit of GSoC is open source and open collaboration. If you keep contributing, you will learn a lot and will have a head start for the next year\u0026rsquo;s program.\nIf your project participates in any other open source internship programs , you can apply for it.\nI\u0026rsquo;m in GSoC! The first three weeks of the program will be a community bonding period. You can use this time to get a feel of the community before you start engaging.\nYou will get to code in the next weeks. A part of the stipend will be provided once you complete one of the two evaluations.\nAnd as mentioned before, the timeline for 2022 is pretty flexible.\nEnding Notes I personally believe GSoC is a great program. It has and will continue to help attract students and new developers to work in open source.\nThe goal for this program is to not make some money (money is important) but to foster open source software.\nThe impact such programs have on the community is incredible. And as GSoC mentees, you inherit the responsibility to pay it forward.\nSo, don\u0026rsquo;t stop contributing after GSoC ends. Be a mentor next time. Help others in the community.\nBest of luck on your GSoC application!\n","permalink":"https://navendu.me/posts/everything-about-gsoc/","summary":"Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a great way to start contributing to open source while getting paid to do so. This article dives deep into everything GSoC from the application procedure to tips from real experience on being successful","title":"Everything you Need to Know About Google Summer of Code (GSoC): Important Dates, Eligibility, Application, Getting Selected and Other Tips"},{"content":"With Hacktoberfest around the corner, here are some tips to make better Pull Requests for your next Open-Source contribution.\n As a maintainer and a contributor to Open-Source projects these are the things I look for when reviewing and take care of when submitting Pull Requests.\n This is a fast read but if you want one even faster, check out this Twitter thread .\nTip 1: Contributing Docs are your Best Friends Most Open-Source projects have a contributing doc(usually a CONTRIBUTING.md file at the root of the repo) that contains all the necessary details on how to set up your development environment, coding conventions you have to follow and much more.\nIf you are looking to contribute to a project, that should be the next place to look into after the ReadME file.\nContributing doc from the Meshery project\nTip 2: Document Your PRs This is really important. I repeat this is really important.\nYou should make the reviewing process as easy as possible and a reviewer should be able to get the context of your PR with a quick glance.\nFor this, you can:\n Write self-documenting code (What is self-documenting code and how can it help? See this great answer ) Use comments liberally in your code Write clear commit messages and Most importantly, comment what your PR does clearly  As shown below, the PR description shows what issue it fixes, the change made in the PR and the actual new User-Experience.\nThis makes the PR very easy to review.\nA Pull Request description example\nTip 3: Use Pull Request Templates Most Open-Source projects will have a Pull Request template to guide newcomers and veterans alike into documenting their PRs properly.\nAs you can see below, the PR template has sections where the contributors are expected to fill details.\nPull Request template from the Open Service Mesh project\nThis would make the job of the reviewer much easier as they would be able to easily test it out, ask a domain expert to review and much more.\nThese also acts like a checklist that the contributor can tick off. For example: Questions like \u0026ldquo;Did I write unit tests?\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Did I sign all of my commits?\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Is this a breaking change?\u0026quot; can be answered as you start filling the template.\nTip 4: Make your PRs Small and Focused Whenever possible, your Pull Requests should do one thing and one thing only.\nThe problem with addressing multiple concerns in a single PR is that the reviewer may not agree with all the changes and this could potentially lead to long discussions.\nSo small and focused PRs would reduce the time taken for reviews and would make your PR most likely to get merged.\nAn Example Pull Request with just a single, focused change\nTip 5: Add Tests If the project you are working on has automated tests, then make sure that you add tests for the code you are adding.\nNot sure if you should write tests? Here is a bonus tip:\n If it can be tested, it should be tested.\n Tip 6: Make sure the Automated Tests Pass Most projects have automated tests in their CI/CD pipelines which run on your Pull Requests.\nThese tests are in place to make sure that the code you are adding passes some constraints. These are mostly lint checks, build checks, unit tests and integration tests.\nIf these checks are not passing, fix it and make sure all the tests pass before asking for a review.\nYour code is not likely to get merged if these checks fail.\nAll checks passed!\nTip 7: Respond to Feedback When you open a Pull Request, you are also opening a discussion on why this change is needed and why your PR is the right way to add that change.\nSo, make sure that you respond to reviews, make changes to your PR as suggested by the reviewer and ask for clarification questions if needed.\nThis would make sure that you and the reviewer are on the same page and would make the PR reviews much easier.\nSometimes discussions can get really long! But these are necessary when you are adding a new feature with breaking changes\nTip 8: Be Patient Most of the Open-Source maintainers are volunteers. They maintain projects during their free time off from their work.\nSo, they may take some time to get to your PR and review it.\nSo be patient while they do their thing. Take a break, drink a cup of coffee and watch Naruto.\nBonus Tip: I will be writing about Contributing to, Building, Scaling and Maintaining Open-Source projects here on my blog as well as on Twitter and on the DEV Community .\nIn this last year, I have went from a noob Open-Source contributor to:\n Building my own project and making it to the #1 Trending Repository on GitHub  Maintaining 2 CNCF Projects and Working full-time in Open-Source  I would like to share everything I\u0026rsquo;ve learned to help as many people as possible who are interested in Open-Source.\nSo, follow along and may the source be with you!\n","permalink":"https://navendu.me/posts/pull-requests-like-a-pro/","summary":"Tips to make High-Quality Pull Requests.","title":"Pull Requests Like a PRO"},{"content":"Do you want to contribute to open-source but you are not sure of your coding skills?\nI have good news for you.\nNon-code contributions are more valuable than contributing code.\nBut what are non-code contributions?

Any contribution that helps an open-source project that does not involve writing code.\nThese can be anything but I have categorised it broadly into these categories:\n ✍️ Writing 🎨 Designing 🧑‍🔬 Testing/Using 👥 Mentoring 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Community Managing/Organising  Let\u0026rsquo;s look at each of these categories in detail.\n1. ✍️ Writing If you are good at technical writing and creating content, then this is for you.\nHere is how you can use your writing skills.\n1.1 Write Documentation Contributing to documentation is really impactful.\nEven if the project is really amazing, without documentation, nobody would be able to figure out how to use it or at least would not get maximum value from the project.\nHere is a tip to help you contribute to docs:\nWhen you first check out an open-source project, go through their existing documentation and see if you can understand or use the project from what you see in the docs.\nMost likely, you will find areas that you can improve.\nOpen issues for these and try to create a pull request adding changes that you think are needed.\nIt is always helpful for projects to have a new pair of eyes look at things. New perspectives and new ideas often come from new contributors.\n1.2 Write Tutorials and Blog Posts If you have been a user of the project and you are looking to contribute to it, then this is the best way.\nYou can write tutorials and blog posts to help people who are using the project.\nYou can also share your own insights and tips while writing these.\nIf the project has a dedicated blog, you can ask to publish there or there are other platforms like this where you can freely publish content.\nI find myself looking for well-written and up-to-date tutorials and blogs instead of going through the documentation.\nThere is no doubt that these will help the project as well as the users of the project.\n1.3 Translate Documentation People from different parts of the world could use your project.\nLanguage barrier is real and sometimes people may prefer Mandarin over English.\nSo, if you know Mandarin and English or any other pair of languages, translate the documentation to the other language.\nThis will open up the project to a whole new user base.\n1.4 Take Control of the Social Handles If your project has social media accounts, take control of it and start creating content.\nEven if you directly do not have access to the accounts, get in touch with the social media manager of the project and suggest content and ways to engage with your users and community.\nThis will drive the project\u0026rsquo;s visibility and will help gain more users and contributors.\n2. 🎨 Designing If you are a creative person and loves designing stuff, this is where you belong.\nHere is how you can use your palette to help the project.\n2.1 Create Art! You can put your skills to use to create artworks for the project to share on social media, blog posts and even swags. (who doesn\u0026rsquo;t like swags!)\n2.2 Create a Style Guide Most open-source projects have a large and a geographically distributed set of contributors.\nAmong other challenges, this makes it difficult to maintain consistency in visual designs.\nAs a designer and a contributor, you can create a style guide to ensure consistency.\n3. 🧑‍🔬 Testing/Using As a user of the open-source project, there are multiple ways in which you can make valuable contributions.\n3.1 Reporting Bugs If you run into any bugs while using/testing the project, raise them.\nOpen up an issue and let the code contributors know about the bug.\nThis will help them identify and fix bugs improving the quality of the project.\n3.2 Become an Advocate/Evangelist Most open-source projects are community-driven and they usually do not have a dedicated marketing team to publicise the project.\nThis is where you step in as a volunteer advocate and talk about the project in events and social media while encouraging people to use the project.\nHere is a tip:\nDon\u0026rsquo;t even ask the project owners before advocating for the project.\nEveryone likes free marketing.\n3.3 Help Improve the User Experience Most open-source project maintainers/code contributors are usually too close to the project to realise bad and unintuitive UX.\nI am and I know a lot of them.\nStep in here wearing your user hat and report these issues.\nThey are always well received.\n3.4 Sign Up for Alpha/Beta Testing Alpha/Beta tests are controlled tests of a new feature or a release to ensure quality and user experience before making it available to the general user base.\nAs a user, you can sign up for the alpha/beta programs and test out the project before the new features are released and provide feedback.\nFeedback from these tests always provide insights that can help in iterating over the features/releases.\n4. 👥 Mentoring Pay it forward by mentoring other contributors.\nHere are some of the ways in which you can do it.\n4.1 Review Code The more people there is to review code, the better the quality of the code will be.\nHaving more eyes on the code would mean less bugs, faster reviews and a better project.\nMost projects let anyone review pull requests and comment on it.\nIf you have opinions, this is the place for you to go.\n4.2 Mentor a Contributor Are you skilled in the project\u0026rsquo;s tech stack?\nCan you help contributors make better contributions?\nPay it forward by becoming a mentor!\nShare your experiences and knowledge and empower them to become a better open-source contributor.\nThere are a lot of open-source programs which connect mentors and mentees.\nI had curated some of these in a previous article. You can check that out here .\n5. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Community Managing/Organising Open-source projects thrive as its community thrives.\nBut who manages this community? Who manages the contributors? Who manages the project?\nThis is where a community manager comes in.\n5.1 Organise the Project Stale issues? Follow up! Issues without proper labels? Add them! Does this issue still exist? Verify and close them! Unclear issue descriptions? Ask for clarification! Unreviewed pull requests? Request for reviews!\nHelp in every way you can to organise the project and make it whistle as a well oiled machine.\nFrom my experience, project organisers and community managers are well recognised in the community as well!\n5.2 Become the Release Manager A release manager keeps track of what everybody is working on and ensures that a project is ready for a release.\nSome of the responsibilities of a release manager are:\n Checking with each team Ensuring different components and features are tested Organising the alpha/beta programs  This list can go on. Basically you decide when the project is ready to make a new release.\n5.3 Organise Events and Meetups Organise project meetings. Represent your project in conferences. Organise community events.\nThis list is note exhaustive.\nGreat community managers go above and beyond and are key players in the success of an open-source project.\n5.4 Get More Chefs to Cook (I mean, non-code contributors) Engineers attract other engineers.\nBut the environment these engineers create are usually not super welcoming to non-code contributors.\nSo, become a steward of the community and make it welcoming to newcomers!\nHost newcomer meetings, share onboarding resources, connect newcomers to mentors.\nWhat would we do without community managers?\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the list! Did I miss anything?\nFeel free to add them to the comments below.\nWhat other open-source related topic should I write about next?\nComment below!\n","permalink":"https://navendu.me/posts/non-code-contributions-to-open-source/","summary":"Open-Source is not just about code.

After all, you have worked tirelessly for the past month on this very challenging project, right?\nWell, let’s just take a step back and look from the perspective of a developer or a user checking your project. Although you know how cool your project is, and how it is going to solve that one pressing problem that hasn’t been fixed(until you came along), the person would be looking at your project and wondering what in the world you have built.\nIf nobody can’t figure out how to use your software, there’s something very bad going on.\n  Photo from imgflip\n  If people don’t know what your software does, then they won’t use it or contribute to it and they will most likely find something more clear and concise in the sea of open-source software.\nThat’s where the README comes in!\nA good README is like the face of your project. It is the first thing a person looks at in your project and it gives them a very brief introduction to your software.\n  Beginning of the README from my NSFW Filter project\n  A good-looking and helpful README file can make your project stand out and grab attention from the developer community.\nIt will help them understand your project, how they can get it working and why they should contribute.\n “Wow, man! Nice rant there! If you know so much about stuff why don’t you tell us how to write then…”\n Hey, I can’t tell you that there is a concrete set of rules and you should follow those rules without swaying for a good README.\nIt doesn’t work like that.\nI will share how I write a README for my Open-Source projects and things that you should consider while you write one for your projects and you will(hopefully) be able to get some insights.\nAlso, remember that you won’t be the README master in a day. Like all things, it takes practice.\nI have been contributing to open-source for a while now and a thing I noticed is that all great projects have an Awesome README.\nYou are on the project page and within minutes you are up and running with your version of the project.\nThere are a lot of contributors, a lot of pull requests, updated versions being released frequently and they all have the common factor of an awesome README.\nA new developer will be able to find all the details to get started like install instructions and contributing guides.\nA new user would be able to find how the project is being used with informative screenshots and demos.\n “I don’t have time for this, show me the README already!”\n Alright, alright, alright (sorry I went a little McConaughey ).\nHere is the README file for my project \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;NSFW\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Filter\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; .

You can also find a \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;template\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; README file that you can directly copy and paste in your projects.\nWell, that winds things up.\nI bid you farewell my grasshopper with these parting words(of wisdom) from the README Sensei(new twitter handle alert!).\n  Photo from imgflip\n  ","permalink":"https://navendu.me/posts/how-to-write-an-awesome-readme/","summary":"A comprehensive guide to writing README that stands out and makes people go WOW!","title":"How to write an Awesome README"}]
